# Offline queue analysis

This subproject reads the app backup as immutable input and writes every generated CSV, JSON, Markdown draft, and plot to
the ignored `output/` directory. It does not import data into the app or modify files under `../backup/`.

From the repository root:

```powershell
uv sync --project analysis
uv run --project analysis anki-note-analysis
uv run --project analysis anki-note-analysis --full
uv run --project analysis pytest
```

Optional paths can be supplied explicitly:

```powershell
uv run --project analysis anki-note-analysis --backup-dir backup --output-dir analysis/output
```

The default command is the routine audit: it replays the production `adaptive_v2` policy and reports the observed queue
distribution. Pass `--full` to additionally run all candidate-policy comparisons, bootstrap window analysis, cross-day
diagnostics, and hyperparameter, maintenance-gap, and cold-start sensitivity experiments.

The routine audit also anchors a deployment review to the first default `adaptive-v2` target set. It reports the actual
distribution for sessions that keep that exact stable target set, checks every observed activation of the 90-review
maintenance guard, and tracks the fixed deployment cohort with equal-note rolling metrics. This remains separate from the
latest-target replay, so adding new notes does not rewrite the stable deployment comparison. If the latest target set still
has notes below the learning-metric evidence threshold, `latest_learning_progress` is `null` until that range matures.
Maintenance replay includes each session's own statistical reviews while it is active, then carries the session into later
history only when the completed session meets the long-term eligibility rules, matching the production call path.
The fixed-cohort details are written to `output/adaptive_v2_observed_distribution.csv`,
`output/adaptive_v2_observed_summary.csv`, and `output/adaptive_v2_learning_progress.csv`, with the compact result in
`output/summary.json` under `adaptive_v2_post_deployment`.

Historical queue replay uses up to eight worker processes by default, while full-mode sensitivity experiments use up to
three. Use `--jobs 1` for a serial run, or pass another positive worker count when resource usage needs to be limited.
Deterministic replay arrays are cached under
`output/cache/historical_queue_replay/`; the cache is invalidated when backup content, the target-note set, replay
parameters, NumPy or pandas version, queue-analysis source, or
[`../src/domain/adaptiveV2Spec.json`](../src/domain/adaptiveV2Spec.json) changes. Removing `output/` is always safe because
it contains generated analysis artifacts only.

The analysis selects the latest session's effective target-note set and uses each note's latest 100 qualified scheduler
reviews for queue metrics. This keeps the evidence count equal across notes without allowing low-volume calendar days to
make one note noisier than another. Daily charts independently use the same P33/P67 review-volume levels as the app
heatmap; medium and high days are retained for robust progress summaries.

Queue backtesting is a distribution replay, not an outcome forecast. At each historical cutoff it freezes measured speed
and error statistics, continuously draws 300 notes from each policy, and updates exposure after every draw. The resulting
`output/queue_replay_*.csv` files show note allocation, tier allocation, effective note count, minimum coverage, and the
longest unseen gap. Cross-day alignment files are auxiliary diagnostics only; historical outcomes cannot reveal what
learning outcome an unchosen policy would have caused.

The production `adaptive_v2` replay reads its constants from
[`../src/domain/adaptiveV2Spec.json`](../src/domain/adaptiveV2Spec.json). Python and TypeScript both verify the shared
adjusted-score and tie-aware tier cases in [`fixtures/adaptive_v2_tiers.json`](fixtures/adaptive_v2_tiers.json).

Tracked conclusions and the offline validation procedure live in
[`../docs/queue-algorithm-analysis.md`](../docs/queue-algorithm-analysis.md).
