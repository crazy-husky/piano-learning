The sampled piano path in `piano.ts` streams Salamander Grand Piano MP3 samples from Tone.js's hosted audio collection.

Future direction: if remote hosting becomes a reliability issue, vendor the sampled piano files under `public/audio/`,
point `piano.ts` at the local base URL, and consider trimming long sample tails to reduce decoded audio memory.
